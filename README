Moxo S3 DAV Proxy Server

This is a first go on two issues:

a) a WebDAV server based on apache-commons-vfs
b) an Amazon S3 provider backend for apache-commons-vfs

The WebDAV server is almost complete. Right now only two tests of the complete webdav
litmus test are failing (one is a warning).

The VFS backend is started and provides write access. You can already use it with the
MacOS X Finder to copy, move and delete etc. files on Amazon S3. Some commands may time out
because the caching of large files from S3 may take a while longer than the WebDAV
client is willing to wait.

INFO:

Subversion: http://thinkberg.com/svn/moxo/trunk

The maven build process is not yet fully completed, so to get this running a little bit
of tweaking is necessary, unless you use IntelliJ IDEA and maven idea:idea to create
an IDEA project file.

To run either the MoxoJettyRunner or the MoxoTest you need to include the src/main/resources
directory in your classpath. Edit the jetty.xml file  to include your Amazon S3 access
information as well as the bucket to use. The bucket will be created from the S3 url you
are providing.

Edit jetty.xml or copy it to a local file and point to it using the following command:

java -cp ... -Djetty.xml=jetty.xml com.thinkberg.moxo.MoxoJettyRunner

TODO:

- Create an executable JAR with all required libraries. The Main is already prepared to do
  that but I have not yet fully understood how to get maven to package the jars right next
  to the compiled classes.
- S3 ACL support
- separate the S3 backend even further by introducing a caching system to speed up operation
