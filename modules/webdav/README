This is a WebDAV implementation that can be integrated into applications or
web applications (using the servlet). It has a pluggable backend architecture
provided by commons-vfs. Any provider usable by commons-vfs can be used.

This implementation has been written to support the Moxo S3 WebDAV Proxy.
Only commons-vfs providers that support file system attributes will pass
the WebDAV Litmus test fully as it requires property handling (storing
arbitrary attributes of files).
